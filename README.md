Loan Default Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan based on their financial history and credit-related features. It uses a classification-based machine learning approach with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix heatmap for evaluation.

🧠 Problem Statement
Predict loan default status (0 or 1) using features like:

Credit Score

Income

Loan Amount

Target Variable: Loan Default (1 = default, 0 = no default)

🔍 What I Did
Loaded the dataset and explored key features.

Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values, scaled features).

Selected important features for classification.

Used Random Forest Classifier to train the model.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Evaluated model performance using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix (with heatmap)

Generated all outputs and results for the report.

📊 Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas

scikit-learn

seaborn

matplotlib

✅ Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the test set using key classification metrics. A confusion matrix heatmap was also generated for better visualization.
